data encryption at arest ?:---------------

Here's what it means:

Data at rest: This refers to data that is stored on a device, such as a hard drive, database, or backup media, and not actively being transmitted across a network.
Data encryption: The process of transforming data into a scrambled, unreadable format using encryption algorithms and a secret key. This key is essential for decrypting the data back into its original form.
Therefore, data encryption at rest ensures that even if an unauthorized individual gains physical access to the storage device or database, they cannot access the information in its original form because it is encrypted. This significantly enhances data security.

Details your client might be interested in:

Encryption algorithm used: Different algorithms offer varying levels of security strengths and performance characteristics. Common options include AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) and RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman).
Key management: How the encryption keys are stored, managed, and accessed. Secure key management is crucial to prevent unauthorized access to the keys, which could render the encryption useless.
Scope of encryption: Which types of data are encrypted at rest (e.g., all data, specific data types)
